## Examples of classes using a ALU example here that gets progressively more complicated-interesting


Here I have created some examples from simple to more complicated of how to construct classes in python.
Starting with the simplest type of situation *not even using the __inti__* function and progressing to more intersting ones using 
inheritance, several examples of multi-menthods in the same class. 

My personal favor is version #7, which *keeps track of the tottal value* during additon of as many runs as you want
at a separate file.txt. 
You can reset this total value using methods within the class. 
It can also simply add two numbers together, 
something like x+y.

**Play with them 
and have fun for yourself as you 
explore you understanding in 
creating classes in python**
